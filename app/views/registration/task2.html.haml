%h2 Task 2
%p
  Please validate the form elements in real time.

%p
  For this send a XHR request to the following endpoint:
  %code= "#{validate_registration_index_path}"

%p
  The endpoint expects Key/Value pairs like:
  %code= "registrations[name]:foo"
  and will return:
  %code
    {"valid":boolean,"errors":Array}

  %ol
    %li Validation should be triggered when the element loses focus.
    %li The password field should not be sent to the endpoint.
    %li Invalid fields should be marked with a red border.
